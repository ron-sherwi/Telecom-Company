# Telecom-Company 
## Give supervisors information on the least effective operators
### Description of the data:
The datasets contain data on the use of the virtual telephony service CallMeMaybe. Its clients are organizations that need to distribute large numbers of incoming calls among various operators, or make outgoing calls through their operators. Operators can also make internal calls to communicate with one another. These calls go through CallMeMaybe's network.

### Goal:
Give supervisors information on the least effective operators.

### Specify details:
Identify operators that have:
- A large number of missed incoming calls (internal and external).
- A long waiting time for incoming calls. 
- A small number of attempts to make a call.

### Mandatory stages of analysis:

- <u> Data preprocessing</u>
- <u>  EDA: </u>
- <u> Define effective & ineffective operators: </u>
- <u> Test statistical hypotheses: </u>
    - Difference between the average incoming calls waiting time of effective and ineffective operators.
    - Difference between the proportions of missed incoming calls of effective and ineffective operators. 
    - Difference between the average number of outgoing calls of effective and ineffective operators.
